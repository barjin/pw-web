## How to run
- The easiest way to run Pwww is to use the official Docker image, [`barjin/pw-web`](https://hub.docker.com/r/barjin/pw-web). By default, this Docker image exposes ports 8000 (HTTP/TCP), 8080 and 8081 (WebSockets/TCP) and those need to be mapped when starting the container using `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ... barjin/pw-web`.
