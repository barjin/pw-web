## How to run
- The easiest way to run Pwww is to use the included Dockerfile, build it (in a folder containing pwww-bundle.zip as well) using `docker build -t barjin/pw-web .` and run it. By default, this Docker image exposes ports 8000 (HTTP), 8080 and 8081 (WebSockets) (needs to be addressed when running using `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 ...`).
